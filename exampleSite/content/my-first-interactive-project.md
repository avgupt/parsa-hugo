In my first semester, I came up with an idea which was new to the world. Sounds cool, right? I had a course Prototyping Interactive Systems. The course motivates students to think out of the box and design, prototype and implement interactive systems.

For the major project of this course, we had to implement an interactive project which is unique in this world. That's right! The first year IIIT Delhi students were told to come up with ideas that people have never even thought of. The journey was scary at first, but it eventually became more engaging and exciting. It was a group project, which made it more fun!! Let me walk you through the process :)

Coming up with an idea unique to this world was no doubt a difficult task. The professor suggested getting our ideas approved by him or the teaching assistants, before we begin the project.

We went for idea approval twice. The first time, we had three ideas, and our professor rejected all of them and the next time, we again had three ideas, and he accepted all three :D The lesson I learnt from this is just because you're at a lower level of success, it doesn't mean you're a failure. Be persistent, and your hard work would give results.

We chose the idea of building an interactive virtual travel experience using a bicycle. We chose this idea because on the basis of what we would enjoy using the most. The basic idea was to play a city video on a screen placed in front of a bicycle and increase the speed of the video as we increase the pedalling speed. Later, we also added the functionality of switching cities on turning the handle left or right.
