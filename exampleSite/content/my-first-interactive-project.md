In my first semester, I came up with an idea which was new to the world. Sounds cool, right? I had a course Prototyping Interactive Systems. The course motivates students to think out of the box and design, prototype and implement interactive systems.

For the major project of this course, we were told to implement an interactive project which is unique in this world. That's right! The first year IIIT Delhi students were told to come up with ideas that people have never even thought of. The journey was scary at first, but it eventually became more engaging and interesting. It was a group project, which made it more fun!! Let me walk you through the process :)

**The Ideation Stage**

Coming up with an idea which was unique to this world was no doubt a difficult task. Before start implementing the project, it was suggested to get our idea approved by the course instructor and teaching assistants. 

Let me tell you a funny story. We went for approval of ideas twice. The first time, we had three ideas and all three were rejected and the next time we again had three ideas and all three were accepted :D The lesson I learnt from this incident is just because you're at a lower level of success, it doesn't mean you're a failure. Be persistent and your hard work would definitely give results.
